Hey, I'm Sebastian.

This Github page is where I will post repositories 
of mine both public and private, primarily for 
portfolio and archival purposes of my projects.

Even if I find some of my past projects inefficient
or poorly written, it is important that I keep them
here because I believe in my work for getting me 
to where I am today, rather than what it is at 
face value.

If you need to contact me for any purpose, reach
me at scapellan55@gmail.com 

I hope you enjoyed reading, and have a good day!
